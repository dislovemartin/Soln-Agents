# Story-1: Implement API service extensions for AutoGen Studio

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to create API service extensions to enable communication between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio, so that data can be exchanged seamlessly between both platforms.

## Status

- [x] Implementation
- [x] Code Review
- [x] Testing
- [x] Documentation

## Context

This story is part of Epic-1: Core Integration Framework, which focuses on establishing the foundational components needed for the SolnAI-AutoGen integration. The API service extensions will act as the primary communication channel between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio, enabling data exchange, configuration management, and agent discovery.

## Estimation

- Story Points: 5
- Expected Duration: 3 days

## Tasks

- [x] Create experimental endpoint directory structure
- [x] Implement configuration retrieval and update endpoints
- [x] Create proxy mechanism for forwarding requests to AutoGen Studio
- [x] Implement agent discovery endpoint for making SolnAI agents available to AutoGen
- [x] Add plugin installation endpoint for AutoGen Studio integration
- [x] Write unit tests for all endpoints
- [x] Document API endpoints with usage examples
## Constraints

- Must be compatible with AutoGen Studio's API structure
- Must handle authentication properly between both systems
