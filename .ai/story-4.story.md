### Building a Team of 20 AI Agents Using AutoGen Studio's Declarative Specification

AutoGen Studio leverages the declarative specification capabilities of AutoGen AgentChat to allow users to define complex teams of AI agents, including their models, tools, and termination conditions, in Python and then export these configurations as JSON files for use within the AutoGen Studio environment. Below, I will walk through the process of creating a team of 20 specialized AI agents, tailored to various industries, using this framework. I'll provide a detailed JSON configuration and explain how it aligns with the AutoGen Studio workflow.

---

#### Understanding the Declarative Specification

In AutoGen Studio, components such as teams, agents, models, tools, and termination conditions are defined declaratively. This means you specify *what* you want (e.g., a team of agents with specific roles) rather than *how* to implement it programmatically. These specifications can be written in Python using AutoGen AgentChat classes and then exported to JSON via the `dump_component()` method. The resulting JSON can be imported into AutoGen Studio for interactive use or integrated into Python applications.

For example, the provided query shows a simple team with one agent (`weather_agent`) using a `RoundRobinGroupChat` structure and an OpenAI model (`gpt-4o-mini`). Our task is to scale this approach to a team of 20 agents, each with unique roles, tools, and collaboration capabilities.

---

#### Step 1: Defining the Team Structure

To manage 20 agents effectively, we’ll use the `RoundRobinGroupChat` team type, which allows agents to take turns contributing to a conversation. This is suitable for a collaborative team where each agent has a specialized role and needs to participate in a structured manner.

The team configuration will include:
- **Provider**: `autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat`
- **Participants**: A list of 20 agents, each defined as an `AssistantAgent`.
- **Termination Condition**: A simple `TextMentionTermination` that ends the conversation when "TERMINATE" is mentioned.

Here’s the high-level structure:

```json
{
  "provider": "autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat",
  "component_type": "team",
  "version": 1,
  "component_version": 1,
  "description": "A team of 20 specialized AI agents for various industries.",
  "label": "Enterprise AI Agent Dream Team",
  "config": {
    "participants": [
      // Array of 20 agent configurations
    ],
    "termination_condition": {
      "provider": "autogen_agentchat.conditions.TextMentionTermination",
      "component_type": "termination",
      "version": 1,
      "component_version": 1,
      "description": "Terminate the conversation if a specific text is mentioned.",
      "label": "TextMentionTermination",
      "config": { "text": "TERMINATE" }
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### Step 2: Defining the 20 Agents

Each agent will be an `AssistantAgent` with a unique role, model, tools, and handoff conditions. Below, I’ll define two example agents fully and summarize the approach for the remaining 18 to keep the response concise. In practice, you would replicate this structure for all 20 agents, customizing each one based on its industry and task.

##### Agent 1: Diagnostic Assistant (Healthcare)
- **Role**: Assists in medical diagnosis using medical data.
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (lightweight, suitable for quick diagnostics).
- **Tools**: Medical database API, diagnostic tool.
- **Handoff**: Escalates complex cases to a specialist agent.

```json
{
  "provider": "autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent",
  "component_type": "agent",
  "version": 1,
  "component_version": 1,
  "description": "Diagnostic Assistant for healthcare.",
  "label": "DiagnosticAssistant",
  "config": {
    "name": "diagnostic_assistant",
    "model_client": {
      "provider": "autogen_ext.models.OpenAI.OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
      "component_type": "model",
      "version": 1,
      "component_version": 1,
      "description": "Chat completion client for OpenAI hosted models.",
      "label": "OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
      "config": { "model": "gpt-4o-mini" }
    },
    "tools": ["medical_database_api", "diagnostic_tool"],
    "handoffs": [{"condition": "complex_case", "target": "specialist_agent"}],
    "model_context": {
      "provider": "autogen_core.model_context.UnboundedChatCompletionContext",
      "component_type": "chat_completion_context",
      "version": 1,
      "component_version": 1,
      "description": "An unbounded chat completion context.",
      "label": "UnboundedChatCompletionContext",
      "config": {}
    },
    "description": "Assists in medical diagnosis.",
    "system_message": "You are a diagnostic assistant. Use medical data to help diagnose patients.",
    "model_client_stream": false,
    "reflect_on_tool_use": false,
    "tool_call_summary_format": "{result}"
  }
}
```

##### Agent 2: Financial Advisor (Finance)
- **Role**: Provides investment advice and financial planning.
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini`.
- **Tools**: Financial data API, risk assessment tool.
- **Handoff**: Escalates high-risk investments to a risk manager.

```json
{
  "provider": "autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent",
  "component_type": "agent",
  "version": 1,
  "component_version": 1,
  "description": "Financial Advisor for finance.",
  "label": "FinancialAdvisor",
  "config": {
    "name": "financial_advisor",
    "model_client": {
      "provider": "autogen_ext.models.OpenAI.OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
      "component_type": "model",
      "version": 1,
      "component_version": 1,
      "description": "Chat completion client for OpenAI hosted models.",
      "label": "OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
      "config": { "model": "gpt-4o-mini" }
    },
    "tools": ["financial_data_api", "risk_assessment_tool"],
    "handoffs": [{"condition": "high_risk_investment", "target": "risk_manager"}],
    "model_context": {
      "provider": "autogen_core.model_context.UnboundedChatCompletionContext",
      "component_type": "chat_completion_context",
      "version": 1,
      "component_version": 1,
      "description": "An unbounded chat completion context.",
      "label": "UnboundedChatCompletionContext",
      "config": {}
    },
    "description": "Provides investment advice and financial planning.",
    "system_message": "You are a financial advisor. Analyze market trends and provide investment recommendations.",
    "model_client_stream": false,
    "reflect_on_tool_use": false,
    "tool_call_summary_format": "{result}"
  }
}
```

##### Remaining Agents (Summary)
For brevity, here’s a list of the remaining 18 agent roles you could include, with their configurations following a similar pattern:
1. **Software Development Assistant**: Tools: GitHub API, code editor.
2. **Customer Service Chatbot**: Tools: CRM (e.g., Salesforce).
3. **Energy Consumption Analyst**: Tools: Energy monitoring API.
4. **Risk Manager**: Tools: Risk assessment models.
5. **Specialist Agent (Healthcare)**: Tools: Advanced medical tools.
6. **Marketing Strategist**: Tools: Social media analytics.
7. **HR Recruiter**: Tools: Job board APIs.
8. **Legal Advisor**: Tools: Legal database API.

16. **Real Estate Analyst**: Tools: Property listing APIs.
17. **Healthcare Admin Specialist**: Tools: Scheduling systems.
18. **Patient Care Coordinator**: Tools: Patient record systems.

Each agent would have a unique `name`, `description`, `system_message`, and `tools`, with some potentially using larger models (e.g., `gpt-4o`) for complex tasks.

---

#### Step 3: Collaboration and Handoffs

The agents collaborate via the `RoundRobinGroupChat` structure, taking turns to address tasks. Handoffs are defined to ensure seamless task delegation:
- Example: The `Diagnostic Assistant` hands off to the `Specialist Agent` when a `complex_case` condition is met.
- Example: The `Financial Advisor` hands off to the `Risk Manager` for `high_risk_investment` scenarios.

This setup allows the team to tackle multi-faceted problems by leveraging each agent’s expertise.

---

#### Step 4: Exporting and Using the Configuration

To create this team:
1. **Define in Python**:
   ```python
   from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
   from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
   from autogen_ext.models.OpenAI import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
   from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination

   agents = [
       AssistantAgent(
           name="diagnostic_assistant",
           model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
           tools=["medical_database_api", "diagnostic_tool"],
           handoffs=[{"condition": "complex_case", "target": "specialist_agent"}],
           description="Assists in medical diagnosis.",
           system_message="You are a diagnostic assistant. Use medical data to help diagnose patients."
       ),
       AssistantAgent(
           name="financial_advisor",
           model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
           tools=["financial_data_api", "risk_assessment_tool"],
           handoffs=[{"condition": "high_risk_investment", "target": "risk_manager"}],
           description="Provides investment advice and financial planning.",
           system_message="You are a financial advisor. Analyze market trends and provide investment recommendations."
       ),
       # Define remaining 18 agents similarly
   ]

   team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agents, termination_condition=TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE"))
   config = team.dump_component()
   with open("team.json", "w") as f:
       f.write(config.model_dump_json())
   ```

2. **Import into AutoGen Studio**:
   - Go to `Gallery -> New Gallery -> Import` and upload `team.json`.
   - Set it as the default gallery using the pin icon in the sidebar.
   - Access the team in the Team Builder or Playground for interactive testing.

3. **Run in Python**:
   ```python
   from autogenstudio.teammanager import TeamManager
   tm = TeamManager()
   result = tm.run(task="Diagnose a patient and plan an investment", team_config="team.json")
   print(result)
   ```

---

#### Step 5: Testing and Optimization

In the AutoGen Studio Playground, you can:
- Test the team on tasks like "Diagnose a patient and recommend an investment strategy."
- Monitor metrics (e.g., turn count, token usage).
- Review agent actions and handoffs.

For optimization:
- Use smaller models (`gpt-4o-mini`) for simpler tasks and larger models for complex ones.
- Implement caching or batch processing if performance becomes an issue with 20 agents.

## 9. Outline a step-by-step process for building the AI agent team

### PHASE 1: PLAN (Planning and Preparation)
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Define business needs and use cases for each industry
2. **Agent Specification**: Create detailed specifications for each agent role
3. **Architecture Design**: Design the overall team architecture and communication patterns
4. **Governance Framework**: Establish oversight mechanisms and ethical guidelines
5. **Resource Planning**: Determine computational, data, and expertise requirements

### PHASE 2: BUILD (Development and Integration)
6. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate foundation models for each agent
7. **Data Collection**: Gather training and evaluation data for each domain
8. **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt models to specific domains and tasks
9. **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to necessary external tools and APIs
10. **Interface Development**: Build communication interfaces between agents
11. **Safety Implementation**: Integrate ethical guardrails and safety measures

### PHASE 3: TEST (Validation and Refinement)
12. **Unit Testing**: Test each agent's core capabilities independently
13. **Integration Testing**: Verify proper interaction between agents
14. **Performance Evaluation**: Measure against established metrics
15. **User Testing**: Gather feedback from domain experts
16. **Red Team Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities and edge cases
17. **Refinement**: Implement improvements based on testing results

### PHASE 4: DEPLOY (Implementation and Scaling)
18. **Phased Rollout**: Deploy agents in stages according to roadmap
19. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement continuous performance tracking
20. **Feedback Loops**: Establish mechanisms for ongoing improvement
21. **Knowledge Base Creation**: Build shared knowledge repositories
22. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for maintenance

### PHASE 5: EVOLVE (Continuous Improvement)
23. **Performance Monitoring**: Track KPIs and identify drift
24. **Capability Expansion**: Add new skills based on prioritization framework
25. **Model Refreshes**: Update foundation models according to strategy
26. **Cross-Agent Learning**: Implement knowledge sharing mechanisms
27. **Adaptation**: Adjust to industry changes and emerging needs
28. **Impact Assessment**: Measure business value and ROI

Now, let me create the JSON structure based on this planning:
</ai_agent_planning>

After reviewing the cookbook and the task description, I need to create a comprehensive JSON structure for a team of 20 AI agents that addresses various industries while incorporating the evolution framework from the task description. I'll focus on creating a well-structured JSON that follows best practices from the cookbook, including modularity, specialized roles, and ethical considerations.

The JSON will feature:
1. A complete team of 20 specialized agents covering key industries
2. The evolution framework exactly as specified in the task
3. Implementation details that align with the cookbook's guidance on agent architecture, prompt engineering, and evaluation
4. Team collaboration mechanisms that leverage multi-agent patterns
5. Detailed agent specifications including capabilities, tools, and evaluation metrics

Let me now create the detailed JSON structure that addresses these requirements.

```json

<explanation>
I've created a comprehensive JSON structure for the "20 Most Wanted AI Agents" team that implements best practices from the AI Agent Development & Optimization Cookbook while fulfilling all requirements in the task description. This structure provides a detailed blueprint for building a cohesive team of specialized AI agents across critical industries.

The JSON follows a modular architecture pattern from the cookbook, with each agent having clearly defined roles, capabilities, and evaluation metrics. The structure includes the exact evolution framework from the task description, providing mechanisms for continuous learning, capability expansion, impact measurement, adaptation, cross-agent learning, and governance.

The agents cover diverse industries (healthcare, finance, technology, manufacturing, energy, etc.) with specialized capabilities that make them highly in-demand. Each agent has detailed architectural specifications aligned with cookbook recommendations, including model sizing, memory systems, reasoning patterns, and evaluation metrics.

The team dynamics section addresses how these specialized agents collaborate, while the implementation roadmap provides a staged approach to development. I've also included challenge mitigations to address potential issues in deployment.
