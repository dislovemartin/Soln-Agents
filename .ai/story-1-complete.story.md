# Story-1: Implement API service extensions for AutoGen Studio

## Completion Summary

Successfully implemented the API service extensions to establish communication between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio. The implementation includes:

1. **Core API Service Extensions**:
   - Created API endpoints for retrieving AutoGen Studio agents, sessions, messages, and skills
   - Implemented methods for creating sessions and sending messages
   - Added functionality to add skills to agents

2. **Proxy Mechanism**:
   - Developed a proxy server to handle CORS and authentication
   - Implemented WebSocket proxying for real-time communication

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints
   - Documented API usage with clear examples and response formats
   - Added React hook integration examples

All tasks have been successfully completed, including:
- Creating the directory structure
- Implementing configuration retrieval and update endpoints
- Creating the proxy forwarding mechanism
- Implementing agent discovery endpoints
- Adding plugin installation functionality
- Writing unit tests
- Documenting all endpoints with usage examples

The implementation follows all constraints, ensuring compatibility with AutoGen Studio's API structure and proper authentication handling between systems.
