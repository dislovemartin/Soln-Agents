# Story-3: Develop React components for integrated UI

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to create React components for an integrated UI experience between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio, so that users can seamlessly work with both platforms through a unified interface.

## Status

- [x] Implementation (Partial)
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [x] Documentation (Partial)

## Context

This story is part of Epic-1: Core Integration Framework. With the API service extensions (Story-1) and data exchange service (Story-2) now in place, we need to develop the UI components that will allow users to interact with both platforms in a unified manner. These components will leverage the existing hooks and services to provide a seamless experience.

## Estimation

- Story Points: 5
- Expected Duration: 3 days

## Tasks

- [x] Create AutoGenStudioPanel component for displaying AutoGen Studio UI
- [x] Develop AutoGenIntegrationUI component for data transfer controls
- [x] Create AgentSelector component for choosing between platforms (implemented as TeamSelector)
- [x] Implement ResultExporter component for sending data between platforms
- [x] Create SessionManager component for handling sessions (integrated into TeamChat)
- [x] Develop MessageViewer component for displaying messages from both platforms (integrated into TeamChat)
- [x] Implement responsive layout adaptations for different device sizes
- [x] Add loading states and error handling to all components
- [ ] Write unit tests for all components
- [x] Document component usage and props (in code comments)

## Implementation Notes

Progress has been made on creating components for multi-agent team support:

1. **Core Component Files Created:**
   - `TeamChatComponent.tsx`: Handles displaying messages from multi-agent teams
   - `TeamSelectorComponent.tsx`: Allows selecting and importing team configurations
   - `AutoGenTeamPage.tsx`: Main container integrating the components

2. **Styling:**
   - Created `AutoGenTeam.module.css` with comprehensive styling

3. **CSS Features:**
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Message bubbles with agent attribution
   - Content type formatting (code, links, images)
   - Modal for team configuration import

4. **Component Integration:**
   - Updated `specialized/index.ts` to export the new components
   - Added mappings for agent IDs to specialized UI components

5. **Documentation:**
   - In-code documentation for components and methods
   - Created extensive mockups and integration documents
   - Created `MULTI_AGENT_UI_MOCKUP.md` with UI visualizations
   - Created `MULTI_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md` for architecture details

Next steps:
- Complete unit tests for all components
- Integrate with real data sources
- Perform end-to-end testing with actual AutoGen Studio multi-agent teams

## Constraints

- Must follow existing SolnAI design patterns and style guidelines
- Must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Must handle loading and error states gracefully
- Must use existing hooks and services for data fetching
- Must provide clear feedback on data transfer operations
