# Story-2: Create data exchange service between SolnAI and AutoGen

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to create a data exchange service that converts between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio data formats, so that information can flow seamlessly between both platforms with consistent structure and metadata.

## Status

- [x] Implementation
- [x] Code Review
- [x] Testing
- [x] Documentation

## Context

This story is part of Epic-1: Core Integration Framework. With the API service extensions now in place (Story-1), we need a standardized way to transform data between the two platforms. The data exchange service will handle format conversions, metadata enrichment, and ensure consistent data structures as information moves between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio.

## Estimation

- Story Points: 4
- Expected Duration: 2 days

## Tasks

- [x] Define standard exchange format schema
- [x] Implement SolnAI → AutoGen data conversion functions
- [x] Implement AutoGen → SolnAI data conversion functions
- [x] Add metadata enrichment functionality
- [x] Implement data validation for both directions
- [x] Create utility functions for common transformations
- [x] Write unit tests for all conversion functions
- [x] Document data exchange service with examples

## Constraints

- Must preserve all essential data during transformation
- Must handle different message formats between platforms
- Must include adequate error handling for malformed data
- Must support various content types (text, links, code blocks, etc.)
