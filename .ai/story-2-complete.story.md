# Story-2: Create data exchange service between SolnAI and AutoGen

## Completion Summary

Successfully implemented the data exchange service that enables bidirectional data conversion between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio. The implementation includes:

1. **Exchange Format Schema**:
   - Defined a standardized `ExchangeFormat` with content, contentType, metadata, and optional structured blocks
   - Created type definitions for content types and block structures
   - Implemented robust metadata enrichment capabilities

2. **Bidirectional Conversion**:
   - Implemented SolnAI → AutoGen conversion for both results and chat messages
   - Implemented AutoGen → SolnAI conversion for messages and result items
   - Added sophisticated content parsing to identify code blocks and other structured content

3. **Data Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive input validation for all methods
   - Implemented robust error handling for API calls and data processing
   - Created safeguards against malformed or empty data

4. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Added content type detection based on input data
   - Created utility functions for common transformations
   - Implemented rich markdown formatting for different content types
   - Added session creation capabilities with result data

5. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all conversion functions
   - Documented all methods with clear examples and usage patterns
   - Added integration examples with React components

The data exchange service now provides a robust foundation for seamless data flow between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio, enabling sophisticated multi-agent workflows.
