# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for SolnAI-AutoGen Integration

## Status: Draft

## Introduction

The SolnAI-AutoGen Integration project aims to create a seamless connection between SolnAI agents and AutoGen Studio, enabling powerful multi-agent workflows and enhanced AI capabilities. This integration will allow users to leverage the strengths of both platforms: SolnAI specialized agent capabilities and AutoGen Studio multi-agent orchestration framework. The integration will facilitate bidirectional data exchange, shared context, and unified user experience across both platforms.

## Goals

- Create a bidirectional integration between SolnAI and AutoGen Studio
- Enable seamless data exchange between SolnAI agents and AutoGen Studio agents
- Provide a unified user experience for working with both platforms
- Maintain independent functionality of both platforms while enhancing their combined capabilities
- Reduce development overhead for users wanting to leverage both platforms
- Achieve 90% feature parity with standalone versions of each platform

## Features and Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- API service extensions for communicating with AutoGen Studio
- Data exchange service for converting between SolnAI and AutoGen formats
- React components for integrated UI experience
- React hooks for AutoGen Studio interaction
- Proxy server for secure communication between platforms
- Docker deployment configuration for easy setup
- Documentation for integration setup and usage

### Non-functional Requirements
