I'll provide you with more advanced information about AI agents, focusing on their specific types, architecture, and implementation details.

# Advanced AI Agent Systems: Types, Architecture, and Implementation

## Types of AI Agents

AI agents can be categorized into several advanced types based on their capabilities and design:

### 1. Learning Agents

Learning agents continuously improve through experience, adapting their behavior based on feedback and outcomes. They consist of four key components:

- **Performance element**: Makes decisions and selects actions
- **Critic**: Evaluates outcomes against performance standards
- **Learning element**: Modifies the performance element based on feedback
- **Problem generator**: Creates exploratory actions to discover new experiences

These agents are particularly effective in environments where optimal behavior isn't known in advance and must be learned through trial and error, such as industrial process control, energy management systems, and adaptive customer service systems.

### 2. Hierarchical Agents

Hierarchical agents organize multiple AI agents in tiers, with higher-level agents breaking down complex tasks and delegating to lower-level agents. Each agent operates independently but reports to supervising agents. This architecture excels at handling complex, multi-step tasks that require different types of expertise.

```python
# Example of hierarchical agent structure with crewAI
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

manager = Agent(
    role="Project Manager",
    goal="Coordinate the project and ensure quality results",
    backstory="You're an experienced manager who excels at coordination"
)

specialist_1 = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights",
    backstory="You're an expert at finding patterns in complex data"
)

specialist_2 = Agent(
    role="Technical Writer",
    goal="Document findings clearly and accurately",
    backstory="You excel at technical documentation"
)

# Manager's planning task
planning_task = Task(
    description="Create a project plan with specific tasks for the specialists",
    expected_output="A detailed project plan with clearly defined tasks",
    agent=manager
)

# Create specialist tasks based on the plan
specialist_tasks = [
    Task(
        description="Analyze the data according to the plan",
        expected_output="Data analysis results",
        agent=specialist_1
    ),
    Task(
        description="Document the findings according to the plan",
        expected_output="Technical documentation",
        agent=specialist_2
    )
]

# Create the crew with all tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[manager, specialist_1, specialist_2],
    tasks=[planning_task] + specialist_tasks
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

### 3. Model-Based Reflex Agents

These agents maintain an internal model of the world to inform their decisions. Unlike simple reflex agents, they evaluate probable outcomes before deciding, building a representation of their environment to support more sophisticated decision-making.

### 4. Goal-Based Agents

Goal-based agents (also called rule-based agents) have robust reasoning capabilities that evaluate different approaches to achieve desired outcomes. They always choose the most efficient path and are suitable for complex tasks like natural language processing and robotics applications.

### 5. Utility-Based Agents

Utility-based agents use complex reasoning algorithms to maximize specific outcomes. They compare different scenarios and their respective utility values, choosing the option that provides the most benefit according to predefined metrics.

## Advanced Agent Architecture Components

### Memory Systems

Advanced AI agents require sophisticated memory management:

#### Vector-Based Long-Term Memory

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class VectorMemory:
    def __init__(self, embedding_function):
        self.documents = []
        self.embeddings = []
        self.embedding_function = embedding_function
    
    def add(self, document):
        # Store the document
        self.documents.append(document)
        
        # Generate and store embedding
        embedding = self.embedding_function(document)
        self.embeddings.append(embedding)
    
    def search(self, query, top_k=3):
        # Generate query embedding
        query_embedding = self.embedding_function(query)
        
        # Calculate similarities
        similarities = [
            cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [doc_embedding])[0][0]
            for doc_embedding in self.embeddings
        ]
        
        # Get top-k matches
        if not similarities:
            return []
            
        top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
        
        return [(self.documents[i], similarities[i]) for i in top_indices]
```

### Tool Integration Framework

Advanced agents can leverage external tools through well-defined interfaces:

```python
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
    
    def register_tool(self, name, description, function, parameter_schema):
        """Register a new tool with the registry."""
        self.tools[name] = {
            "name": name,
            "description": description,
            "function": function,
            "parameter_schema": parameter_schema
        }
    
    def get_tool_descriptions(self):
        """Get descriptions of all registered tools."""
        return [
            {
                "name": tool["name"],
                "description": tool["description"],
                "parameters": tool["parameter_schema"]
            }
            for tool in self.tools.values()
        ]
    
    def execute_tool(self, tool_name, parameters):
        """Execute a tool with the given parameters."""
        if tool_name not in self.tools:
            return {"error": f"Tool '{tool_name}' not found"}
            
        try:
            tool = self.tools[tool_name]
            result = tool["function"](**parameters)
            return {"result": result}
        except Exception as e:
            return {"error": str(e)}
```

## Advanced Prompt Chain Development

Sophisticated AI agents often use prompt chains to break complex tasks into manageable steps:

### Parallel Processing in Prompt Chains

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Callable, Awaitable

class ParallelPromptChain:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "parallel_chain"):
        """Initialize a parallel prompt chain."""
        self.name = name
        self.nodes = {}
        self.dependencies = {}
        self.processors = {}
    
    def add_node(self, 
                node_id: str, 
                prompt_template: str, 
                processor: Callable[[str, Dict[str, Any]], Awaitable[str]],
                depends_on: List[str] = None) -> None:
        """
        Add a node to the parallel chain.
        
        Args:
            node_id: Unique identifier for the node
            prompt_template: Template string with {variables}
            processor: Async function to process the prompt
            depends_on: List of node IDs this node depends on
        """
        self.nodes[node_id] = {
            "id": node_id,
            "template": prompt_template
        }
        
        self.processors[node_id] = processor
        self.dependencies[node_id] = depends_on or []
    
    async def execute(self, initial_context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Execute the parallel prompt chain.
        
        Args:
            initial_context: Initial variables for the chain
            
        Returns:
            Final context after execution
        """
        # Initialize or copy context
        context = initial_context.copy() if initial_context else {}
        
        # Track completed nodes
        completed_nodes = set()
        
        # Create execution plan based on dependencies
        execution_plan = self._create_execution_plan()
        
        # Execute each level in parallel
        for level in execution_plan:
            # Execute all nodes in this level in parallel
            tasks = []
            
            for node_id in level:
                task = self._execute_node(node_id, context)
                tasks.append(task)
            
            # Wait for all tasks in this level to complete
            results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            
            # Update context with results
            for node_id, result in zip(level, results):
                context[f"{node_id}_response"] = result
                completed_nodes.add(node_id)
        
        return context
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Structured Output with Grammar Constraints

Using libraries like llguidance for efficient, grammar-constrained outputs:

```rust
use llguidance::{Grammar, ParseEngine};
use std::time::Instant;

// Define a simple grammar for product information
fn create_product_grammar() -> Grammar {
    let grammar = r#"
    product ::= "{" whitespace? "\"name\"" whitespace? ":" whitespace? string whitespace? "," whitespace?
                "\"price\"" whitespace? ":" whitespace? number whitespace? "," whitespace?
                "\"categories\"" whitespace? ":" whitespace? array whitespace? "}"
    array ::= "[" whitespace? (string (whitespace? "," whitespace? string)*)? whitespace? "]"
    string ::= "\"" ([^"]|"\\\"")* "\""
    number ::= [0-9]+ ("." [0-9]+)?
    whitespace ::= [ \t\n\r]+
    "#;
    
    Grammar::from_string(grammar).unwrap()
}

// Process a prompt with grammar constraints
fn process_with_grammar(llm: &mut dyn LLM, prompt: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    // Create grammar and parse engine
    let grammar = create_product_grammar();
    let engine = ParseEngine::new(grammar);
    
    // Set grammar constraint
    llm.set_grammar_constraint(engine);
    
    // Generate
    let result = llm.generate(prompt);
    
    result
}
```

### Batching and Caching Strategies

Implement efficient caching to avoid redundant computations:

```python
import hashlib
import redis
from functools import lru_cache
import time

class OptimizedInferenceService:
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer, redis_url=None, cache_ttl=3600):
        # Initialize model components
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        
        # Set up redis cache if URL provided
        self.redis_client = redis.from_url(redis_url) if redis_url else None
        self.cache_ttl = cache_ttl
        
        # Set up in-memory LRU cache as fallback or primary (if no Redis)
        self.memory_cache = lru_cache(maxsize=1000)(self._generate_raw)
    
    def _generate_cache_key(self, prompt, params):
        """Generate a unique cache key based on inputs."""
        key_parts = [prompt] + [f"{k}={v}" for k, v in sorted(params.items())]
        key_string = "|".join(key_parts)
        return f"llm:response:{hashlib.md5(key_string.encode()).hexdigest()}"
    
    def _generate_raw(self, prompt, **params):
        """Raw generation without caching."""
        # Process input
        input_ids = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(self.model.device)
        
        # Generate output
        with torch.no_grad():
            output_ids = self.model.generate(
                input_ids,
                max_new_tokens=params.get("max_tokens", 512),
                temperature=params.get("temperature", 0.7),
                top_p=params.get("top_p", 0.9),
                do_sample=params.get("temperature", 0.7) > 0
            )
        
        # Decode output
        response = self.tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0][input_ids.shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
        
        return response
    
    def generate(self, prompt, **params):
        """Generate text with caching."""
        # Check if caching is disabled
        if params.get("disable_cache", False):
            return self._generate_raw(prompt, **params)
        
        # Try Redis cache first if available
        if self.redis_client:
            cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(prompt, params)
            cached_response = self.redis_client.get(cache_key)
            
            if cached_response:
                return cached_response.decode('utf-8')
        
        # Generate response (using in-memory cache)
        # We need to make params hashable for lru_cache
        cache_params = tuple(sorted(params.items()))
        response = self.memory_cache(prompt, *cache_params)
        
        # Store in Redis if available
        if self.redis_client:
            cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(prompt, params)
            self.redis_client.setex(cache_key, self.cache_ttl, response)
        
        return response
```

## Challenges in Advanced AI Agent Development
