With the browser extension, you can:

- Send entire webpages or just highlighted text snippets to SolnAI
- Embed information directly into your SolnAI workspaces
- Collect or embed web content that is password protected, VPN protected, or otherwise inaccessible to the public internet straight from your browser.

_All offerings of SolnAI support the browser extension._

# Customizing the Browser Extension

**_Docker only:_**
By default, the image in the browser extension is the SolnAI logo. However, it will automatically use the logo of the instance you are connected to if set in the `Customization` section of the settings page.

If you want to further customize the browser extension, you can do so by forking the [SolnAI Browser Extension GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/SolnAI-extension) and making your own changes.

Once you have made your changes, you can build the extension using the `yarn build` command.

After building the extension, you can load it into your browser by clicking the `Load unpacked.` button in Chrome and selecting the `dist` folder.
