# What is the SolnAI Community Hub?

The [SolnAI Community Hub](https://hub.SolnAI.com) is a platform and marketplace for SolnAI users to share system prompts, slash commands, agent skills, and more.

The community hub enables you to share your own items, skills, and workflows with the SolnAI community both **publicly** and **privately**.

Currently, the SolnAI Community Hub is in **beta** and as such, not all types of items are supported.

### Current Supported Item Types

- [x] Agent Skills
- [x] System Prompts
- [x] Slash Commands

_More item types are coming soon!_

- [ ] Workspaces
- [ ] Data Connectors
- [ ] Authentication Providers
