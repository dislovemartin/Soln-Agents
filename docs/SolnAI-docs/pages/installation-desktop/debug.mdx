## General Debugging

If you are having issues with SolnAI, the first thing you should do is check the logs. You can find the logs in the `logs` folder of your SolnAI storage - which you can find [on your computer using this guide.](./storage.mdx#where-is-my-data-located)

## SolnAI Debug mode on MacOS

To run the SolnAI Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/Applications/SolnAI/Content/MacOs` where you can then run the executable and see all application logs while running SolnAI.

## SolnAI Debug mode on Windows

To run the SolnAI Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a CMD or Powershell window and run the path to the SolnAI executable. Typically this is in `C:\Users\usr\AppData\Local\Programs\SolnAI-desktop\SolnAIDesktop.exe`.
This will print all logs to the powershell window while running and should display a verbose error once encountered that is critical for debugging.

## SolnAI Debug mode on Linux

To run the SolnAI Application in debug mode (if you are getting errors) you can open a Terminal and navigate to `~/.config/SolnAI-desktop/SolnAIDesktop.AppImage` where you can then run the executable and see all AppImage logs while running SolnAI.
