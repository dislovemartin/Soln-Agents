## General Debugging

If you are having issues with SolnAI, the first thing you should do is check the logs. You can find the logs in the `logs` folder of your container.

## SolnAI Debug mode on Docker

Open `Container Logs` in Docker desktop or print the logs via `docker container <CONTAINER_ID> logs`
